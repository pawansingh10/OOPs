# OOPs


## Introduction to Oobject Oriented Programming
**
- In order to understand **OOPs**, first understand **Objects**
- In order to understand **Objects** first  understand **Primitive Data Type**

### **Primitive Data Types**
***
- Variable that stores single, simple values
- Example
  - **Byte**
  - **char**
  - **boolean**
  - **Int**
  - **Float**
  - **double**
  
- When program is small & so simple programmers uses Primitive Data types However As programs became Large & Complex Primitive Data tpes is not sufficient

- So Programmers start using the group of Primitive data types

- **Structure & Array**
| Structures | Arrays |
|------------|---------|
| Stores groups of data | Stores groups of data|
| Can store different types of data | Can store only similar types of data|
| Heterogeneous | Homogeneous|
| store int, char, bool or even another struct |stores only similar data types|

### Issues with Structures
***
- The main problem with structure is that you **Cannot define functions** within a structure

- In the world of OOPs, **Objects allows us to store data of different kind together along with Funtions additionally**


### **Objects**
***
  - **Objects** are instances of a **class**
  - **Classes** are templates for an **Objects**
  
- ```code
     class Human:
          name ;
          age ;
          //Not initialize the instance variable because for different obj its value is different
          eat();
          speak();
          move();
          // methods are same for every obj that's why it's is define within class
  ```
  
> **OOPs hepls programmers to create complex programs by grouping related Data and Functions together**
- Data_1, Function1, Data_2, Function2, Function3, Data_3 etc
- | data | Function|
